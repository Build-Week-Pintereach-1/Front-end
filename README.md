# Pintereach

Pintereach allows users to search thousands of academic articles via the Public Library of Science's (PLOS) API. Users can then save articles to customized boards, as well as add their own notes on the article. 

The current version of the project is depoloyed here: https://pintereach-bw.netlify.com/
